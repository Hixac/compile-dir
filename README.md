## Easy compile extension for Emacs

`project-compile` often require either git extension for easy use or manual setting so it's not very handy.
`compile` is simple as heck it just do command in directory where file belongs so it's not very optional.

So my extension solve these problems.

# Quick start

To use it just do two steps:
1. `M-x set-compile-directory [directory you want to chose] RET`
2. `M-x compile-dir [shell-command] RET`
